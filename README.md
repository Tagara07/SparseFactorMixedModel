### Version history

#### V1.0
Published version in MATLAB
on website: ![](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~sayan/bfgr/index.shtml)
- includes Ayroles_et_al_Competitive_fitness, Simulations with half-sib design
- should be able to replicate all analyses from paper (up to Monte-carlo error in Gibbs and in simulations)

#### V1.1
- Fixed calculation of genetic and interaction specific effects. The calculation and corresponding text of the paper missed $A^{-1}$. This should not greatly affect the results of the analyses presented in the paper, but will need to check. It doesn't affect Ayroles analysis.
